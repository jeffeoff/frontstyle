	<h1>frontstyle</h1>
	<p>A portable front-end styling (scss) setup for efficiently handling a variety of styling tasks. frontstyle  provides the following tasks, pre-configured:</p>

	<ul class="list square">
		<li><i>fast</i> compilation of scss to css (with sourcemaps): <code>gulp css</code></li>
		<li>compilation of scss to css, as scss changes: <code>gulp watch</code></li>
		<li>as above, but with <a href="http://livereload.com/">livereload</a><sup>&#8224;</sup>: <code>gulp watch-reload</code></li>
		<li>sprite generation: <code>gulp sprites</code></li>
		<li>production output: <code>gulp production</code>: autoprefixes, uglifies, and concats css + uglifies and concats js.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><sup>&#8224;</sup> <small><code>gulp watch-reload</code> loads a tiny livereload server which interfaces
	seamlessly with the livereload plugin. Make sure the little circle in the plugin's toolbar icon is filled-in,
	you may have to click the toolbar icon to activate it.</small></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

	<ol class="list number">
		<li>You must have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed, preferably via <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>.</li>
		<li>To install, run <code>npm install</code> from the project's root directory. You may need to <code>sudo npm install</code></li>
	</ol>

<h2>SASS Stack</h2>
	<p>frontstyle comes pre-configured with the following incorporated into sass:</p>

	<ul class="list square">
		<li><a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>, a css reset.</li>
		<li><a href="http://bourbon.io/docs/">bourbon</a>, a sass mixin library.</li>
		<li><a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">bourbon neat</a>, a grid system built on bourbon.</li>
		<li><a href="http://include-media.com/">include-media</a>, robust and simple sass media queries.</li>
		<li><a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/">font-awesome</a>, beautiful icons.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><small>Note: The vendor SASS stack is directly @imported via .scss files, not installed by npm. while this
	locks in the versions included, it also reduces a lot of the cruft added by these packages if you install
	them via npm, bundler, etc. Also, some of these libraries would require gem or bower or other package
	management systems to install, and I want to keep this entire front end stack as simple as possible and
	relying only on npm and node.</small></p>

	<p><small>To remove any component of the SASS stack, simply delete the component subdirectory under
	assets/scss/vendor/, then remove the associated @import line from _screen.scss.</small></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Extras</h2>
	<p>Some helpful notes.</p>

	<ul class="list square">
		<li>scss is compiled via node-sass, a node port of libass, which is much faster as nearly as feature complete as ruby-sass.</li>
		<li>_sprite.scss is automatically updated when sprits are created. use the <code>@include sprite([sprite img filename without extension]);</code> to add sprites throughout your scss.</li>
		<li>Sprite generation is not part of css compilation, to keep compilation fast. You only need to run <code>gulp sprites</code> each time you add new sprites to assets/images/sprites/.</li>
	</ul>

			<p>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.</p>

			<p>Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and  called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing  out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once  in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it  had made.</p>
			<p>'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How  surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him  his fan and gloves&mdash;that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she  came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass  plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without  knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the  real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the  fan and gloves.</p>
			<p>'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for  a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she  began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come  here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,  nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't  think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it  began ordering people about like that!'</p>

			<p>"Do you think," he asked, "if I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?"</p>
			<p>"I cannot tell," she returned, "but you may come with me, if you like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now."</p>
			<p>"That is true," said the Scarecrow.  "You see," he continued confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt.  If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it.  But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?"</p>
			<p>"I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him.  "If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for you."</p>
			<p>"Thank you," he answered gratefully.</p>
