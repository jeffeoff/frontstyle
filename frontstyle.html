<section>
	<h1>frontstyle</h1>
	<p>A portable front-end styling (scss) setup for efficiently handling a variety of styling tasks. frontstyle  provides the following tasks, pre-configured:</p>

	<ul class="list square">
		<li><i>fast</i> compilation of scss to css (with sourcemaps): <code>gulp css</code></li>
		<li>compilation of scss to css, as scss changes: <code>gulp watch</code></li>
		<li>as above, but with <a href="http://livereload.com/">livereload</a><sup>&#8224;</sup>: <code>gulp watch-reload</code></li>
		<li>sprite generation (supporting retina sprites): <code>gulp sprites</code> or <code>gulp sprites-retina</code> if you also have retina sprites.</li>
		<li>production output: <code>gulp production</code>: autoprefixes, uglifies, and concats css + uglifies and concats js.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><sup>&#8224;</sup> <small><code>gulp watch-reload</code> loads a tiny livereload server which interfaces
	seamlessly with the livereload plugin. Make sure the little circle in the plugin's toolbar icon is filled-in,
	you may have to click the toolbar icon to activate it.</small></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

	<ol class="list number">
		<li>You must have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed, preferably via <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>.</li>
		<li>To install, run <code>npm install</code> from the project's root directory. You may need to <code>sudo npm install</code></li>
	</ol>

<section>
<h2>SASS Stack</h2>
	<p>frontstyle comes pre-configured with the following incorporated into sass:</p>

	<ul class="list square">
		<li><a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>, a css reset.</li>
		<li><a href="http://bourbon.io/docs/">bourbon</a>, a sass mixin library.</li>
		<li><a href="http://include-media.com/">include-media</a>, robust and simple sass media queries.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><small>Note: This vendor SASS stack is directly @imported via .scss files, not installed by npm. While this
	locks in the versions included, it also reduces a lot of the cruft added by these packages if you install
	them via npm, bundler, etc. Also, some of these libraries would require gem or bower or other package
	management systems to install, and I want to keep this entire stack as simple as possible and
	relying only on npm.</small></p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Extras</h2>
	<p>Some helpful notes.</p>

	<ul class="list square">
		<li>scss is compiled via node-sass, a node port of libass, which is much faster as nearly as feature complete as ruby-sass.</li>
		<li>_sprite.scss is automatically updated when sprites are generated.</li>
		<li>Add images to assets/images/sprites/ to include them when sprites are generated (resulting spritesheet is in assets/images/sprites.png).</li>
		<li>Any image filenames ending in @2x will be stitched into a separate assets/images/sprites@2x.png sheet.</li>
		<li>use <code>@include sprite($spriteFileName);</code> to add sprites throughout your scss.</li>
		<li>use <code>@include sprite2x($spriteFileName, $spriteFileName-2x);</code> to add retina sprites (with fallback for non-retina).</li>
		<li>Sprite generation is not part of css compilation, to keep compilation fast. You only need to run <code>gulp sprites</code> (<em>or</em> <code>gulp sprites-retina</code>) each time you add new sprites to assets/images/sprites/.</li>
	</ul>

<section>
	<h3>Sprites</h3>

	<strong>Retina Sprites</strong><br>
	<small>If you have a retina-capable device, retina versions of these sprites will appear, otherwise non-retina versions are served.</small>

	<blockquote>
		<span class="sprite2x bigphoto"></span>
		<span class="sprite2x monster"></span>
		<span class="sprite2x sun"></span>
	</blockquote>

	<strong>Non-Retina Sprites</strong>
	<blockquote>
	<span class="sprite bigphoto"></span>
	<span class="sprite monster"></span>
	<span class="sprite sun"></span>
	</blockquote>
